// Dynamic Highlighting attempts to respect in-file syntax extensions.
// It's janky and slow 
//  (it's implemented by, every few seconds, re-parsing the file (while involves running phase-1+ code),
//    and finding long lines in the syntax extension to mark where the language changes),
//  but it makes for a cool demo!
